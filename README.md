# hdx4vs
Haskell Extension for Visual Studio.  
This vsix is under development.

## Depends

This vsix depends on these libraries. 
*  [language-haskell](https://github.com/JustusAdam/language-haskell)  
Currently, [syntaxes](https://github.com/JustusAdam/language-haskell/tree/master/syntaxes) files are included directly.  
Maybe, it is better that it should be vsix separated.

* [haskell-ide-engine](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine)  
  It is the language server.
* debugging
  * [haskell-dap](https://github.com/phoityne/haskell-dap)
  * [haskell-debug-adapter](https://github.com/phoityne/haskell-debug-adapter)
